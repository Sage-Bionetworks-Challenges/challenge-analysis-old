# Challenge Analysis Template
What this project is: A template project for post-challenge analysis with template R markdown files describing important common post-challenge analyses, and a general explanation of how they are done.

What this project isn't: A codebase for running analyses.

## Template structure
`/analysis`: Contains all code notebooks and rendered `html` notebooks.

`/figures`: You could, if you like, store rendered results from your analyses here, so that you can find them when it's time to publish!

`/data`: Where is `/data`? It's a better practice to store the data on Synapse, in the challenge project, so that others can reference the data if they so choose. 

## Using github.io
As seen in the table below, you can optionally and ideally knit your code notebooks to html so that they can be displayed on github.io. In order to set this up, you should enable Github Pages in the Settings for your project, and configure it to use the `gh-pages` branch as source. Once you've done this, any `html` files in the `gh-pages` branch will be rendered on github.io.

# Your Challenge Name Here
You should insert the name and description of your Challenge here, with a link to the Challenge project. 

## Post-challenge analyses
Here's a summary of the analyses we've run so far.
